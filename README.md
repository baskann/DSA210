### Spotify & Spending Behavior Analysis

**Motivation**:  
In this project, I aim to analyze the relationship between music metrics such as "energy" and "valence" in my Spotify listening habits and my spending behaviors. Understanding whether there is a meaningful connection between music preferences and financial behaviors is both a personal curiosity and an opportunity to closely examine the impact of music preferences on daily life.

**Research Questions**:

- Are specific music genres related to spending amounts?
- Is there a relationship between music listening and spending amounts?
- How does my spending behavior correlate with my music repetition patterns? (Do I spend more on days when I listen to familiar songs repeatedly vs. when I explore new music?)

**Data**:

- **Spotify Data**: Track name, artist name, listening times (endTime), duration (msPlayed), streaming history data, and music genres (obtained via Spotify API).
- **Spending Data**: Spending data obtained from bank and credit card statements (date, amount).

**Data Source and Collection Process**:  
The data sources for this project include my Spotify listening history and personal bank and credit card expenditure records. The Spotify data will be obtained directly from my account, and the expenditure data will be collected in Excel format from bank statements and credit card records. Throughout the data collection process, personal privacy and data security will be prioritized. Both datasets will be appropriately cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis in alignment with the project's scope.

**Data Analysis**:  
The project uses various techniques in data analysis. In analyzing music listening and spending behavior, I used EDA in looking at daily patterns and distributions; correlation analysis between genre spending with statistical significance testing; and categorical analysis to understand the music genres' impact on spending. The pattern recognition analysis focuses on song repetition rates and their relation to spending behavior. Those relations are presented effectively by using different visualization methods, including scatter plots, time series plots, and bar plots, together with a detailed correlation heat map. All analyses focus on quantitative approaches to finding meaningful relations between music listening and spending behavior.

**Expected Outcomes**:  
I expect to gain meaningful insights into how music listening habits affect financial behaviors through these analyses. For example, the effect of specific music genres or high-energy music on spending behaviors will be particularly examined.

**Limitations and Future Work**:  
Since the data used in this project only covers my own listening and spending habits, generalization may be limited. In the future, similar analyses are planned with a larger dataset.
