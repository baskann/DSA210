### Spotify & Spending Behavior Analysis

**Motivation**:  
In this project, I aim to analyze the relationship between music metrics such as "energy" and "valence" in my Spotify listening habits and my spending behaviors. Understanding whether there is a meaningful connection between music preferences and financial behaviors is both a personal curiosity and an opportunity to closely examine the impact of music preferences on daily life.

**Research Questions**:

- Are specific music genres related to spending amounts?
- Is there a relationship between music listening energy and spending amounts?
- How does emotional positivity level (valence) affect my spending behavior?

**Data**:

- **Spotify Data**: "Energy" (0.0 - 1.0 range), "Valence", "Tempo" (BPM), listening times, music genres.
- **Spending Data**: Spending data obtained from bank and credit card statements (date, amount).

**Data Source and Collection Process**:  
The data sources for this project include my Spotify listening history and personal bank and credit card expenditure records. The Spotify data will be obtained directly from my account, and the expenditure data will be collected in Excel format from bank statements and credit card records. Throughout the data collection process, personal privacy and data security will be prioritized. Both datasets will be appropriately cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis in alignment with the project's scope.

**Data Analysis**:  
A diverse set of data analysis techniques will be employed in this project. Initially, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to explore the overall structure, distribution, and potential relationships within the data. This process will include correlation analysis to examine relationships between music metrics such as energy, valence, and spending amounts. Time series analysis will be used to investigate daily music listening and spending patterns, identifying any notable trends or seasonal behaviors. Additionally, categorical analysis will be applied to assess the impact of different music genres on spending behavior. Following EDA, visualization techniques will help intuitively present these relationships. Finally, machine learning models will be utilized to uncover potential impacts of music listening habits on spending behavior, providing deeper insights and predictive capabilities.

**Expected Outcomes**:  
I expect to gain meaningful insights into how music listening habits affect financial behaviors through these analyses. For example, the effect of specific music genres or high-energy music on spending behaviors will be particularly examined.

**Limitations and Future Work**:  
Since the data used in this project only covers my own listening and spending habits, generalization may be limited. In the future, similar analyses are planned with a larger dataset.
