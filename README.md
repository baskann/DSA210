### Spotify & Spending Behavior Analysis

**Motivation**:  
In this project, I aim to analyze the relationship between music metrics such as "energy" and "valence" in my Spotify listening habits and my spending behaviors. Understanding whether there is a meaningful connection between music preferences and financial behaviors is both a personal curiosity and an opportunity to closely examine the impact of music preferences on daily life.

**Research Questions**:

- Are specific music genres related to spending amounts?
- Is there a relationship between music listening energy and spending amounts?
- How does emotional positivity level (valence) affect my spending behavior?

**Data**:

- **Spotify Data**: "Energy" (0.0 - 1.0 range), "Valence", "Tempo" (BPM), listening times, music genres.
- **Spending Data**: Spending data obtained from bank and credit card statements (date, amount).

**Data Source and Collection Process**:  
Spotify data was downloaded from Spotify's "Settings > Privacy > Download your data" section. Spending data was obtained from bank and credit card statements in Excel format.

**Data Analysis**:  
The following analysis techniques will be used in the project:

- **Correlation Analysis**: To understand the relationships between metrics such as music energy, valence, and spending amounts.
- **Time Series Analysis**: To examine daily music and spending patterns.
- **Categorical Analysis**: To investigate the effect of music genres on spending amounts.

**Expected Outcomes**:  
I expect to gain meaningful insights into how music listening habits affect financial behaviors through these analyses. For example, the effect of specific music genres or high-energy music on spending behaviors will be particularly examined.

**Limitations and Future Work**:  
Since the data used in this project only covers my own listening and spending habits, generalization may be limited. In the future, similar analyses are planned with a larger dataset.
